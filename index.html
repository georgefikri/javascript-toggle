            Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
            Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,
            when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.
        </p>

    <!-- div 2 that will be shown after the click and hidden by default -->
    <div id="div2" class="hide">
        <h2>sub</h2>
        <div class="closeX">X</div>
        
        <!-- clear both div -->
        <div class="clear"></div>

            Why do we use it?
            It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using
